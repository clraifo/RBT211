/*
In this version, the two external LEDs alternate blinking in the default state. When the ISR is triggered by the pushbutton,
they are turned off and the onboard LED blinks at the same rate. The blink rate of the LEDs can be adjusted by changing 
the value of the Output Compare Register A (OCR1A) for Timer1. 

To increase the blink rate (make the LEDs blink more frequently), decrease the value of OCR1A. 
To decrease the blink rate (make the LEDs blink less frequently), increase the value of OCR1A.

The actual blink rate can be calculated using the following formula:

Blink rate (in seconds) = (OCR1A + 1) * Prescaler / F_CPU (current settings = (15624 + 1) * 1024 / 16,000,000 â‰ˆ 1 second)

- This version uses Timer1 interrupt to alternate between the two external LEDs
- The button press will still be handled with an external interrupt
- When pressed, it will stop the external LEDs from blinking and turn them ON
- Additionally, it will start the on-board LED (PB5) to start blinking
- Once the button is released, the two external LEDs will resume their alternating pattern and the on-board LED will stop blinking

This version maintains a global button_flag variable to keep track of whether the button is currently pressed. This 
flag determines which LED(s) to toggle in the Timer1 compare match ISR.

The INT0 ISR has been modified to check the button_flag. If the button was not previously pressed, it turns on both external LEDs 
and sets the flag. If the button was previously pressed, it turns off both external LEDs and the on-board LED, and clears the flag.

Connect external LEDs to PD6 and PD7
Connect button input to PD2
