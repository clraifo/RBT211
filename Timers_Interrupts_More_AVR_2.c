/*
Two external LEDs alternate blinking in the default state. When the ISR is triggered by the pushbutton, they are turned off and the onboard LED blinks 
at the same rate. The blink rate of the LEDs can be adjusted by changing the value of the Output Compare Register A (OCR1A) for Timer1.

To increase the blink rate (make the LEDs blink more frequently), decrease the value of OCR1A. To decrease the blink rate (make the LEDs blink less 
frequently), increase the value of OCR1A. The actual blink rate can be calculated using the following formula:

Blink rate (in seconds) = (OCR1A + 1) * Prescaler / F_CPU (current settings = (15624 + 1) * 1024 / 16,000,000 â‰ˆ 1 second)

- This uses Timer1 interrupt to alternate between the two external LEDs (PB6 and PB7)
- The button press is be handled with an external interrupt
- When the button is pressed, the external LEDs will turn OFF and the the on-board LED (PB5) starts blinking
- When the button is pressed again, the circuit returns to the default state of PB^ & PB7 alternating blinking and onboard LED OFF

This version maintains a global button_flag variable to keep track of whether the button is currently pressed. This flag determines which LED(s) to 
toggle in the Timer1 compare match ISR.

The INT0 ISR has been modified to check the button_flag. If the button was not previously pressed, it turns on both external LEDs and sets the flag. 
If the button was previously pressed, it turns off both external LEDs and the on-board LED, and clears the flag.
