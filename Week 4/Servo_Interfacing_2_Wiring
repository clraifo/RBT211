**Servo Motor**
Connect the control wire of the servo motor to the OC1A output, which is pin 
PB1 or digital pin 9 on the Arduino Uno R3.

**Push Button**
Connect one terminal of the push button to digital pin PD2 or digital pin 2 
on the Arduino Uno R3. Connect the other terminal of the push button to GND.

**Potentiometer**
Connect one of the outer terminals of the potentiometer to 5V. Connect the 
other outer terminal to GND. Connect the middle terminal, which is the wiper, to the ADC0 input, 
which is pin PC0 or analog pin A0 on the Arduino Uno R3.

Here are the detailed instructions:

- Servo Motor:
  - The servo motor has three wires: power (usually red), ground (usually black or brown), and 
    signal (usually yellow or white).
  - Connect the power wire to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
  - Connect the ground wire to one of the GND pins on the Arduino.
  - Connect the signal wire to digital pin 9 (PB1/OC1A) on the Arduino.

- Push Button:
  - The push button has two terminals.
  - Connect one terminal to digital pin 2 (PD2) on the Arduino.
  - Connect the other terminal to a GND pin on the Arduino.
  - When the button is pressed, it will connect digital pin 2 to ground. Since the internal pull-up 
resistor is enabled for this pin in the code, the pin will normally read as `HIGH` and will read 
as `LOW` when the button is pressed.

- Potentiometer:
  - The potentiometer has three terminals: two end terminals and one middle terminal (the wiper).
  - Connect one of the end terminals to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
  - Connect the other end terminal to a GND pin on the Arduino.
  - Connect the middle terminal to analog pin A0 (PC0/ADC0) on the Arduino.
  - The potentiometer acts as a voltage divider, and the voltage at the wiper will vary between 
0V and 5V as you turn the knob. This voltage is read by the ADC to determine the delay between 
servo movements.

Always remember to turn off the power supply while you are wiring to prevent any accidental short 
circuits or other issues. Once you have made all the connections, you can turn on the power supply 
and upload the program to the Arduino.
